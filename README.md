TodoApp
- An efficient task management application showcasing backend development expertise with modern technologies like Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, Prisma, and Docker.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- Node.js & Express.js: Built a scalable REST API with proper routing and middleware.
- PostgreSQL: Used as the relational database to store users and todos.
- Prisma ORM: Simplified database interaction with an elegant and type-safe query system.
- Docker: Deployed the app with containerisation for consistent and portable runtime environments.
- JWT Authentication: Secured API endpoints with JSON Web Tokens for authentication and session management.

üöÄ Features
User Authentication:
- Secure user registration and login with hashed passwords using bcrypt.
- JWT-based authentication for protected routes.

Todo Management:
- Create, read, update, and delete tasks with user-specific data segregation.
- Default task created upon user registration.

Containerised Deployment:
- Dockerised app for consistency across environments.
- Database and app run in isolated containers using Docker Compose.

Database Interaction:
- Prisma ORM for structured database schema and seamless migrations.
- PostgreSQL backend to handle relational data efficiently.

Scalability & Modularity:
- Clean code architecture with separation of concerns (routes, middleware, and database models).


üì¶ Installation & Setup
